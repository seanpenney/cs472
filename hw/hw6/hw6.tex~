\begin{enumerate}
\item[$(6.1)$] 

  There are many criteria for judging computer performance.
  These include efficiency, throughput, latency, relative performance, and time and rate.
  Performance is difficult to define because of the different criteria, and also because different people are concerned with different performance criteria.

\item[$(6.4)$]

  Efficiency = bits of data words / total bits sent = 16384 / 16608 = 98.65%
  
\item[$(6.7)$]

  a.  Cycle 1, 2, and 3 would all take 50 ns so 150 ns total.
  
  b.  Cycle 1, 2, and 3 would all take 40 ns so 120 ns total.
  
  c.  Cycles 1 and 2 would take 30 ns.  Cycle 3 would still take 32 ns, so 92 ns total.
  
  d.  Cycle 1 would take 20 ns, but cycle 2 would take 25 ns and cycle 3 would take 32 ns.  77 ns total.
  
  e.  Cycle 1 would take 10 ns, but cycle 2 and 3 would take 25 and 32 ns.  67 ns total.
  
\item[$(6.11)$]

  Some operations are not scalable, and it is difficult to alter the clock rate dynamically from clock pulse to clock pulse.
  Due to this, computers may become unstable if you try to overclock them.
  
\item[$(6.13)$]
