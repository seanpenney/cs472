\begin{enumerate}
\item[$(1.3)$] We said that the pattern of $1$s and $0$s used to represent an instruction
  in a computer has no intrinsic meaning. Why is this so and what is the implication of
  this statement?

  %Answer goes here -- make sure you put a blank line between question and answer.
\item[$(1.5)$] Modify the algorithm used in this chapter to locate the longest run of
  non-consecutive characters in the string.
\item[$(1.8)$] What are the differences between RTL, machine language, assembly language,
  high-level language, and pseudocode?
\item[$(1.12)$]What is the difference between a computer's \textit{architecture} and its
  \textit{organization}?
\item[$(1.18)$]What is the von Neumann bottleneck?
\item[$(1.33)$]Is Moore's law a law?
